RIDE
=============

This project is design to making planning rides for large groups of people much 
easier by digitally streamlining the process. Users create events which then 
contain rides for users to join. There is also a default need ride 'ride' for
users who cannot find a ride.

Dependencies
------------
* MySQL - Backend datastore
* WebAuth - Currently RIDE is configured to be behind WebAuth. However, this can 
easily be changed to work with a different authentication system.
